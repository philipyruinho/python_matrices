# Python Matrices

This is a task :pencil: performed at the request of ***Professor Alkimin of FATEC - Americana.***

## Functionalities

It consists of a program that performs some basic operations with matrices such as:

:heavy_check_mark: addition;

:heavy_check_mark: multiplication; and

:heavy_check_mark: transposition of matrices.

The first two files are independent exercises, from exercise 03 to 06 I created a module to take advantage of the functions.

Enjoy!
