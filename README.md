### Functions

:white_check_mark: cria_matriz() -> matrix dimension and values input

:white_check_mark: cria_matriz_nula() -> creates a null matrix

:heavy_plus_sign: soma_matriz(A, B) -> adds two matrices

:heavy_minus_sign: sub_matriz(A, B) -> subtracts two matrices

:heavy_multiplication_x: multiplica_matriz(A, B) -> multiplies two matrix

:point_right: transposta_matriz(A) -> transposes a matrix

:raising_hand: identidade_matriz(A) -> creates identity matrix

:performing_arts: inverter_matriz(A) -> invert a matrix

:printer: imprimir_matriz(A) -> prints a matrix

There are some files to exemplify the features explained above.
